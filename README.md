### Setup Instructions üöÄ

- You need some Development environment to work with Laravel you can use Valet or Sail.
- Clone the project: `git clone git@github.com:ArielMejiaDev/project-sample.git`
- Create an env file (check that you are in the root directory of the project): `cp .env.example .env`
- Set your Database driver (it is already set for SQLite to make the project setup easier).
- You can set a database with Mysql or SQLite to test that everything is working.
  - The easiest way is to make a SQLite Database in your terminal:
    ```
    cd database
    touch database.sqlite
    ```
- To test the endpoints you can use POSTMAN, here is a Postman Collection link to test it manually easier: [Here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/b2e0f5f70be685e2970f)
